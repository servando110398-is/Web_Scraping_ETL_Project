BACKGROUND  :blue_book: :soccer: :question:

"La Liga" it's the name of a professional soccer league in spain. They update their website with the most current current stats regarding teams, players and games. They provide number of points per team, goals scored ,etc. In this simple project I'll scrape data from the classification table and store it into SQL Server management system.

WEB SCRAPING 

I'll use Python and beautifulsoup and Pandas libraries to perform the data collection  and manipulation of this project.
Once data it's prepared, It'll be stored in SQL Server. Transact SQL will be used to create a table and test if data was correctly stored.
